# Named Entity Recognizer

This project is designed to help you extract and categorize named entities from text using state-of-the-art NLP models like `dslim/bert-base-NER` and Spacy's `en_core_web_sm model`.
<br>

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying key information (entities) in text into predefined categories. This can include names of people, 
organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

This application is built with Streamlit and utilizes spaCy and transformers to provide an interactive web interface built on top of Streamlit for performing NER on user-input text.
